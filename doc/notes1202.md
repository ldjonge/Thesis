# Findings
## Introducing a new Morph
While repeated simulations do confirm earlier suspicions that it is much easier for a phenotype coded by a dominant allele to infiltrate a population, they also show that resistant alleles do have a potential to arise in populations, and then be maintained through NFDS. The probability of this happening is noticeably lower, and this is particularly notable when introducing O into a mono-I population, where the rare phenotype does not have an inherent fitness advantage.  
The simulations also show that introducing a second/third morph into a population does improve female fecundity, even if the newly introduced morph has a lower baseline fitness (A).

### General conclusions
A quadratic-like relationship between morph frequencies and overall female fecundity does appear to show up for all three morphs. The 'optimal' frequency as expected is nearly equal between I and O, but lower for A. Optimal frequencies do not add up to 1, indicating there is not necessarily a balance there, although this may also be simply due to the lack of one morph in the majority of the simulations.  
Due to the large number of simulations, covering most of the 'frequency space', the sigmoid relationship between morph frequency and morph preference does show up in these simulations, even if the deviation from linear is not too big. A linear relationship still fits morph fecundity vs morph frequency best.

## Migration
Much like when artificially introducing a new morph, migration has a relatively high probability of introducing new morphs into a population. Due to the possibility of repeated migration, as well as the migration of fertilised females, migration in fact has a very high chance of new morphs staying present in populations after they have been introduced. I will need to play around more with numbers to study founder effects etc.
