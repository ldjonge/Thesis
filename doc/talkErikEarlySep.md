* Learning process seems awfully complicated and unknown, is it worth figuring out an acceptable way of simulating it or is it better to avoid simulating learning at all?
* Similarly the way mate preference affects fecundity is not well documented, so it is tough to simulate this as well. At this point it may seem as useful to adapt the formulas from LeRouzic2015  and Svensson2005 to determine fitness
* Is there a reason to account for say temperature specifically, or can abiotic factors be represented as a single parameter? Arguments for either seem reasonable, there will presumably always be a 'residual' abiotic factor as we don't know all the specifics (predators, interspecific mating harassment etc.)

* Database quality - some things don't add up, also morph/colour phase inconsistencies/immatures counted as mature
  * All rufescens females (547/550) are marked as obsoleta, and therefore included in the figures for mating rate and frequency figures, whereas violacea females are generally not (only 10-15%)
  * Rufescens females have a ~7% mating rate, Mature obsoleta 55%, so when counting all obsoleta in db this averages out to ~30%, which is lower than not only infuscans but also androchromes (though not statistically significant)
  * By including rufescens but not violacea in frequency figures, this presumably skews frequency figures in favour of obsoleta, are they even rarer than previously presumed?
