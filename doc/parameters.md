# Individual Model
## Individual level variables:
* Fecundity per morph, in 'eggs laid': Fec
* Survival rate per morph and for males, either until maturity or per 'iteration': Surv
###  Assuming mate search:
*  Male preference per morph, either pre-determined or specified per male: Pref
* Chance of successful mating, per morph and for males: MSucc
* Effects of successful and failed mating on all above parameters in both partners
* 'Father' distribution in fertilised females, assuming sperm competition

### No mate search:
* Number of times mated, possibly morph dependent?
* If females can mate multiple times, sperm competition

## Population level variables:
*  Carrying capacity
*  Allele frequencies --> Morph frequencies

## Migration parameters
* Moment of migration should be decided
* Probability of migration from each pop to each other pop
* Any 'new' populations should have all above parameters pre-decided


#Population Model -- Probably not happening 
  Allele frequencies --> Morph frequencies
  Carrying capacity
  Fecundities
  Male preferences --> dependent on morph frequencies
