# Make chance of males finding a mate dependent on their preference, confused males less likely to find a mate (Buridan's ass) -- Properly check out Gavrilets2002

As male preference is recorded per morph, some 'mate finding' factor could be calculated from the preferences, maybe just take the highest normalised preference? Might be ok although its important to realise that preferences will never be 100%, so any other failures should be excluded. 

# Make survival to maturity dependent on morph/temperature. Probably have a temperature parameter per population, which will affect survival rate. Perhaps have a similar system with carrying capacity still, but with more survivors, and subsequent temperature-related death in the immature imago stage. -- Reread Svensson2019 in press

# Adjust fecundity to directly count number of eggs, without the additional irrelevant step

# Incorporate male mimicry, either in detection rate or in male misidentification.

#  Adjust recording functions so that non-trimorphic populations can still be graphed properly

#  Find a good way to make the pretty 3d plots with morph frequency as a triangular x/y-axis, fitness on z-axis.

# Find good ways to generalise the model so it can apply to other species as well (in a slightly adapted version).

# Possibly make a start on migration again?
