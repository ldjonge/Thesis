# New Learning Model
The current learning model is based on the assumption that males may or may not have a preference upon emerging, which if present would be genetically determined. The possibility of learning before the first mating attempts should still be discussed, but either way interactions with females have an effect on mate preference. The preference for a morph will increase upon successful mating with said morph, and decrease after a failed mating attempt.

Mating attempts have a negative effect on female fecundity. It might be good to model in such a way that while the effect of mating attempts are the same whether successful or not, successful mating 'removes' the female from the mating population, and as such reduces the probability of future harassment. 

## Males
### Parameters
* Innate preference (possibly based on genotype)
* Learning speed
* Survival?
* Fertility?

## females
### Parameters
* Mating resistance
* Fecundity
* Survival?
