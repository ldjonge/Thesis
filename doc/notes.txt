2 Models: Full population and individual-based.

##Biological background needed:
    How many generations per season --> Usually 1 but sometimes multiple, depends on environment
    How many eggs per generation --> Incorporate in fecundity?
   ~50% sex split?

##Baseline fixed stuff:

#Shared effects:
  Population size variable
  Reproduction chance related to both pop-size (carrying capacity) and phenotype frequency, NFDS
 ~Assume dominant/recessive is fixed unlike Kagawa et al.
 ~Dominance levels: A > I > O
  Environmental effects of phenotype on fitness

# Full population:
  Allele Frequency --> Phenotype frequency is dependent??
  Reproduction isn't random, a given percentage survives
  Both single and multiple-deme model, migration possibilities

# Individual:
 ~Each female has 2 alleles that determine phenotype
 ~Males have same alleles but are carriers, no effect
 ~Reproduction is actual random chance
  One male can reproduce multiple times, females only once but produce multiple offspring
  Innate preference for certain phenotype?
 ~Single population, no migration effects

##Stuff to test
  Effects of lower fecundity of andromorphs
  Male fitness affected by presence of andromorphs
  Male reproduction dependent on choice, competition and willingness to 'mate' other males
  Different population setups
  Learning speed

#Possible but unlikely inclusions:
  mutation
  Male choice affected by genotype
  More andromorph mating harassment when male frequency is high?
