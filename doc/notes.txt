2 Models: Full population and individual-based.

##Biological background needed:
    How many generations per season
    How many eggs per generation
    50% sex split?



##Baseline fixed stuff:

#Shared effects:
  Population size variable
  Reproduction chance related to both pop-size (carrying capacity) and phenotype frequency, NFDS
  Assume dominant/recessive is fixed unlike Kagawa et al.
  Environmental effects of phenotype on fitness

# Full population:
  Allele Frequency --> Phenotype frequency is dependent??
  Reproduction isn't random, a given percentage survives

# Individual:
  Each female has 2 alleles that determine phenotype
  Males have same alleles but are carriers, no effect
  Reproduction is actual random chance
  One male can reproduce multiple times, females only once but produce multiple offspring
  Innate preference for certain phenotype?

##Stuff to test
  Effects of lower fecundity of andromorphs
  Male fitness affected by presence of andromorphs
  Male reproduction dependent on choice, competition and willingness to 'mate' other males
  Different population setups
  Learning speed

#Possible but unlikely inclusions:
  mutation
  Male choice affected by genotype
