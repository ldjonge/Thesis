# Exclusions
Genetic basis for learning. Very interesting but currently too complicated to add, perhaps later but for now lets assume not


# Things to implement, how?
Costs of learning/memory

# Things to implement, doable but not done yet
Simplify model, i.e. A vs H, I vs O only, this includes introducing a way that dimorphic populations are treated as such, and there is no constant preference for non-existent morphs. Adjusting this for the potential introduction of a new morph through migration will be interesting, but could almost certainly be done. 
A vs H model may have to exclude learning altogether if we want to distinguish between mimicry and LMR, instead simply reducing harassment based on A frequency

Reduce probability of finding a mate based on presence of preferred morph, males won't actually choose between 200 females.
## Ideas:
Randomly sample 10? individuals from a population as potential mates, male chooses between these based on preference, if preferred morph isn't there than much reduced chance of mating.
Average preferences for each of the 10 individuals, this is chance of finding a partner, then weighted choice from the sample.
