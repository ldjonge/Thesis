## Questions to ponder
Is there a relevant difference between learning speed and learning strength?
Can preference and fecundity be simplified to be a single parameter, perhaps depending on population size? This would be super interesting to find out, may be possible to analyse with the new data that will be finished on Saturday. If not enough variation in population size, run again with either more variation in population size between generations or with variation in the sizes between populations.

## Must Analyse Data once finished
Maybe set up a new run already? Have more variation in the population size but perhaps no monomorphic populations as these are irrelevant for the current ideas (want to know parameters to maintain variation, monomorphic doesn't exactly help with that)
Could be done with relative ease as the server will be able to run both, though may take some work to set up to prevent output from getting mixed up.

## Things to implement
See if there is a way to 'reproduce' learning vs. fixation graphs. This may have to be simplified a lot but could be helpful just to prove a point. This can be done without implementing any difference in male mating success, probably simplifying preference and fecundity to be a single 'output' variable affecting the frequency in the next generation. If done properly this could be a whole new part of the research, with proper presentable results in a hopefully fairly short additional timeframe.
Adjust male mating success rate to be less "Buridan's ass", more realistic
